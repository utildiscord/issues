When describing the issue, you need to take care of following things:
- For features request, Tell us everything and describe it clearly and briefly.
- For bug reports, Provide a brief summary and also tell the steps to reproduce the bug
- For documentation improvements, Tell us the page and closest anchor (if you know).
- For other issues, Just be descriptive.

Tips:
- This supports advanced markdown. (Code blocks, Bold and italic texts. Just like discord's markdown)
- You can also use emojis easily like: `:emoji_name:`

### Selecting Labels

Labels are used to organize issues in category like bugs, feature requests etc. Click on labels dropdown and select related labels.

Once you have submitted the issue, Visitors and Maintainers can see your issue. We will review your issue. You, visitors and maintainers can use Comments to discuss the issue.

When the issue is sorted out, It is closed.

- For bug reports, It remains open till bug is not fixed.
- For feature requests and improvements, It remains open till the feature or improvement has been added to bot.
